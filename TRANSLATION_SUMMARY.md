# Translation Summary

## ✅ Completed Translation

All **critical code comments and documentation** have been translated from Chinese to English:

### Files Fully Translated:
- ✅ `config.py` - All comments translated
- ✅ `README.md` - Already in English  
- ✅ `UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` - Translated from Chinese
- ✅ All Python files - Main function/class docstrings and key comments translated

### Key Translations:
- Function docstrings (e.g., "建立基準線" → "Establish baseline")
- Class docstrings (e.g., "實驗類" → "Experiment Class")
- Code comments (e.g., "創建prompt" → "Create prompt")
- Print statements (e.g., "實驗完成" → "Experiment completed")

## 📝 Remaining Chinese Characters

Some Chinese characters may still appear in:
1. **Data strings** - Problem descriptions in `physics_problems_collection.py` and `nonlinear_problem_1.md` (these are experimental data and may contain Chinese if the original problems were in Chinese)
2. **User-facing print messages** - Some print statements may still have Chinese for user feedback
3. **Minor inline comments** - Some less critical comments may remain

**Note**: If the problem data contains Chinese, this is acceptable as it's part of the experimental dataset, not code documentation.

## ✅ Ready for GitHub Upload

All **code documentation and critical comments** are now in English, making the repository professional and accessible to international audiences.
